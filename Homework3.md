The Real Housewives, despite their superficiality and emphasis on appearance, are surprisingly a rather political bunch. In analysis of campaign spending, 10 Housewives were found to give in 2015 and 2016. 
The most politically giving city was the Real Housewives of New York City, with Carole Radziwill, former wife of a Kennedy cousin who made her Hillary Clinton support a prominent part of her storyline this season, and Bethenny Frankel, she of the Skinnygirl empire of moderately priced alcohol, being the most prominent. Dorinda Medley, who also voiced support openly on the show, and Countess Luann de Lesseps, who was more hidden with her views, also gave to pro-Hillary and pro-Democratic PACs.

Erika Girardi and Eileen Davidson of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills both gave to Hillary and Dem PACs, with Girardi giving (all in her name, but some on behalf of her husband, famed class action-lawyer Tom Girardi of Erin Brokovich fame) a total of $122,600 within the two years searched.

Adrienne Maloof, of the Maloof family that made their money through beer distribution and casinos, was the only current and former Real Housewife of the nearly 100 who gave to Republican and Donald Trump-backing PACs in the regular election. Her contributions totaled $10,000.

Other Real Housewives that gave were Phaedra Parks, from Atlanta, who has taken a more politically active stance on the show in the past few seasons; and Ana Quincoces (who gave to a pro-Jeb Bush PAC in the primary) and Lea Black, whose husband is another high-profile attorney, of the now-defunct Real Housewives of Miami.

Records for receipts from any current and past members of the Real Housewives of New Jersey, Orange County, D.C., Dallas, and the latest iteration, Potomac, were not found.
