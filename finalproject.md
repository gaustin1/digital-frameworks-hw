President Donald Trump is likely the country’s first billionaire president. He also may be the first and only president with a “brand,” which includes a portfolio of properties – hotels, golf clubs and commercial buildings – as well as household things like ties and dress shirts. While presidents in the past have built “brands” or at least made money off their names after they are out of office, Trump is likely the first to do this before and during his presidency.

This, needless to say, has created ethical violation issues, as Trump has been accused of using private companies on the public dime. The same is true of his daughter, whose clothing and shoe brand was notoriously promoted by presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway in a television interview earlier this year. (Ivanka Trump has since tried to distance herself publicly from her political and business interests. Despite this, her clothing company, which she owns but no longer manages, recently received trademark approval in China, where she is very popular.)

Trump has also been away from the White House quite a bit since being sworn into office, not least because of new construction on the White House that was pushed off by the past few administrations and has recently begun in earnest. This construction involves heating and plumbing updates and rewiring, some of it reportedly top-secret.  

Thus, the convergence of Trump’s brand and his absence from the White House means he has spent quite a few days at Trump properties. Of 208 days in office, he has spent 70 days at Trump properties and 54 days at golf properties, according to NBC News, which has been tracking this data in a collaboration between NBCNews.com and the NBC News White House unit. 

Of Trump property, he most frequents Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, where Trump has spent 25 days, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., is next, albeit that isn’t far from his primary abode. 

Trump has said Mar-a-Lago is his “winter White House.” And while he has played a lot of golf there, he has also hosted the Chinese president at the historical estate. It is often host to social galas and fundraisers, which recently made news because of the number of cancellations, including the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the Red Cross, and the Cleveland Clinic.

Mar-a-Lago, located in West Palm Beach, Florida, was built in the late 1920s by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post. PoliticoPro reported that Trump’s Easter weekend at Mar-a-Lago cost taxpayers more than $3 million, much of it from the costs associated with using Air Force One.

Trump International Hotel has created a lot of controversy, much of it due to issues of Trump being “landlord and tenant,” as Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., said in July. In other words, because it is a federally owned building. Trump vowed to take no profit during his presidency from the D.C. hotel, but he has retained ownership. And the hotel made nearly $2 million in profit by early August. 

Of his golf properties, Trump National Bedminster in New Jersey, where he most recently was in August, is his top pick, spending a total of 24 days there. This has been labeled his “summer White House,” or his top vacation spot. United Way of Monmouth and Ocean Counties in New Jersey also recently made news for pulling out of the venue for an event over the events in Charlottesville.

Next on Trump’s top visited places are his golf course in the D.C. area, Trump National Golf Club, and his two in Florida, Trump National Jupiter and Trump International West Palm. 

Trump National Golf Club came under fire recently for having a plaque near the 15th hole dedicated to a fake Civil War battle, and at a time when the president has been criticized for his reaction to Charlottesville.  

Trump National Jupiter and Trump International West Palm both recently made news, too, for losing events. Those that have pulled out say it is due to a natural cycling of locations, direct opposition to Trump and his comments post-Charlottesville or just a bid to keep all patrons happy.

In August, Trump recently visited Trump Tower for three days, making news as it was the first time since his inauguration. It has significant importance for Trump. This was where he first made his presidential candidacy announcement in June 2015. 

So far, Trump has spent the most vacation days in August, with July and February the next most-visited vacation months. Trump has spent the most consecutive days away from the White House in August, too, for more than two weeks. And with Congress on recess in August, and White House maintenance under way, more time will probably be spent away from 1600 Penn and instead at his Trump properties.

And there are benefits of Trump using his properties, say experts. Food, lodging and other expenses are paid personally by the president when they stay at their vacation properties. And he’s in good company. President Ronald Reagan stayed at his California ranch for almost a full year of his eight years in office.

Trump has far more properties to visit, both domestic and international, hotels and golf clubs. For instance, Los Angeles, Scotland and Dubai all have golf clubs. Maybe in the foreseeable future he will visit them on local and global trips, but as he is wont to do, his visits will likely stir more controversy. 

Explanation: I was interested in this article because it's really relevant and juicy, in a way, as it covers the president. It is also easy to find many news stories on anything related to the president. It's a data set but not too bogged down with numbers and relatively easy to understand. To start my news story, I used a lot of the data as a jumping-off point and used real-time news to expand on it. Even after beginning writing the story, there was news coming in that could be added to suplement the data and current news on the president. All of the data was available in a spreadsheet that NBC created. The spreadsheet was relatively basic, with only four columns, just the location, date, and whether it was over the weekend or not. So it would also be easy to create graphs and charts from, which NBC did in their short story on the subject.
