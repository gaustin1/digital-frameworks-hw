President Donald Trump is likely the country's first billionaire. He also may be the first and only president with a "brand," which includes hotels, golf clubs, and even ties. He also has been away from the White House quite a bit, not lest because of new construction on the White House that was pushed off for the past few administrations. Thus, the convergence of Trump's brand and his absence from the White House means he has spent quite a few days at the Trump properties.
