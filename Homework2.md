Liz Cheney has towed the party line, voting for Paul Ryan as speaker of the house as her vote. She voted yes on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 and the Commodity End-User Relief Act, which would both remove more financial regulations on the financial sector by the SEC. Cheney also voted yes on consideration of a bill to outlaw taxpayer-funded abortions.

Cheney also voted against several resolutions and bills by the Department of Interior to expand conservation and parks. She also voted for the HIRE Vets Act.

In comparison to Gregg Harper, a Mississippi Republican, she voted almost identically to him, besides a few occasions where one did not vote.
