I found the top 10 unisex names from a FiveThirtyEight data set and their frequency in the total American population. The top names were Casey, Riley and Jessie. Frequency-wise, Casey to Riley is deep dive, with Jessie and Jackie leveling out, and then there's another exponential nosedive from Jackie to Peyton. The first name, Casey, occurs nearly 180,000 times, while the 10th name, Kendall, occurs less than 80,000 times in the total U.S. population.
